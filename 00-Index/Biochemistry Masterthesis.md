###  **1. Discovery of Novel Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) via Deep Learning in Structural Proteomes**

- **Problem**: SLiMs like the new F-actin binding motif (SFM) are difficult to predict due to their short and variable sequences.
- **Idea**: Train a deep learning model (e.g. Transformer-based) on known SLiMs across species using both sequence and predicted structure from AlphaFold2 (e.g. pLDDT, orientation).    
- **Goal**: Predict novel SLiMs in under-characterized or disordered proteins; maybe experimentally verify a few with the lab.    
- **Outcome**: Publication + methodology transferable to any protein-ligand binding motif.

###  **2. Cross-species Conservation and Function Prediction of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) using Language Models**

- **Problem**: Many PTMs (like AMPylation, UMPylation, phosphocholination) are rare and hard to detect    
	- **Idea**: Use protein language models (ESM-2, ProtT5) to embed thousands of bacterial and human proteins. Fine-tune a classifier to predict likely PTM sites or the enzyme-substrate specificity.    
- **Bonus**: Use attention maps to suggest diverging binding modes in bacterial vs. eukaryotic enzymes.    
- **Collaborative hook**: Experimental team can validate top hits.

###  **3. Structure-Conditioned Prediction of F-actin Binding Interfaces**

- **Problem**: Only a few motifs like SFM or Lifeact are known to bind actin; experimental detection is slow.    
- **Idea**: Use AlphaFold2 Multimer to model candidate F-actin–peptide complexes, then train a graph neural network (GNN) on known complexes to learn actin-binding interfaces.    
- **Application**: Screen disordered regions of proteins to predict new actin-binding motifs beyond the PSSM approach in the paper.    
- **CV Value**: GNN + AlphaFold2 integration is cutting-edge and attractive to Isomorphic Labs.

###  **4. Meta-predictor for Substrate Specificity of Bacterial Effector Enzymes**

- **Context**: In the AMPylation vs UMPylation paper, specificity diverges between human and bacterial enzymes.    
- **Idea**: Build a model that learns specificity from a combination of sequence, structure, electrostatics (via APBS), and docking data.    
- **Bonus**: Train with few-shot learning using transfer from other enzyme families.    
- **Goal**: Predict which proteins are likely to be targeted by novel bacterial effectors (e.g., in pathogens or microbiomes).

###  **5. Explainable AI for Structural Motif Emergence (Ex Nihilo)**

- **Idea**: Study how short motifs like the SFM might evolve spontaneously. Simulate point mutations on disordered regions and model them with AlphaFold2 + docking to actin or Rab1b.
- **ML angle**: Use generative models (e.g. ProteinGAN or sequence VAEs) to explore sequence space and identify motifs that are both disordered and functionally binding.
- **Goal**: Publish a methodology that combines generative biology with structural constraints—highly relevant for future therapeutic design work.

###  6. **Machine Learning to Predict Enzyme Substrate Specificity in Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs)**

- **Why it fits:** The lab studies AMPylation, UMPylation, and phosphocholination—modifications catalyzed by specialized enzymes (e.g., FIC-domain proteins).    
- **Thesis idea:** Develop a model (e.g. graph neural network or transformer) that predicts **enzyme-substrate compatibility** or **modification site likelihood** based on **sequence and structural features**.    
- **Novelty:** Few models currently do this beyond phosphorylation.    
- **Relevance to Isomorphic Labs:** It involves protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions—critical to AlphaFold and drug design.

###  7. **Unsupervised Representation Learning of PTM Enzyme Families Using Protein Language Models**

- **Goal:** Use embeddings (e.g. from ESM-2, ProtT5, or AlphaFold) to **cluster or classify** bacterial and human enzymes based on **function or nucleotide specificity**.    
- **Extension:** Correlate clusters with observed activities (AMPylation vs UMPylation) from the lab’s datasets.    
- **Outcome:** May uncover **sequence/structure motifs** underlying substrate choice.    
- **Publication potential:** High if paired with wet-lab validation (lab might help).    

---

###  8. **Structure-Informed Prediction of Ligand Binding and Specificity in Nucleotide-Using Enzymes**

- **Use AlphaFold structures** or PDB models of FIC domain enzymes.    
- Train models (e.g. 3D CNNs or equivariant GNNs) to classify or regress **binding energy/specificity** for AMP vs UMP.
- **Input:** Protein-ligand complexes, residue-level features.    
- **Ideal for:** Linking ML with docking, energetics, or specificity prediction.

###  9. **Creating a 3D Atlas of Post-Translational Modifications Using Public Structures and Lab Data**

- Use ML to **map known and predicted modification sites** (AMP, UMP, phosphocholine) across AlphaFold-predicted structures.    
- Create an interactive tool or database that **visualizes PTM landscapes** on structures.    
- **Data sources:** PRIDE, UniProt, lab datasets.    

---

###  10. **Predicting Functionally Important Mutations in PTM Enzymes**

- Use sequence- or structure-based ML to identify **key residues** that determine specificity (based on mutagenesis data like in the UMP/AMPylation paper).    
- Could involve: feature importance in protein transformers, counterfactual modeling, or latent space traversals.    
- **Goal:** Assist experimentalists in **targeted mutagenesis**.    
---

###  11. **Explainable AI for Post-Translational Modification Site Prediction**

- Develop interpretable models (e.g., attention-based transformers) that highlight why a certain lysine/serine/etc. is a likely modification site.    
- Apply to Rab1b and other proteins from the lab's datasets.    
- **Deliverable:** Tool to guide **hypothesis generation** for experimental design.
