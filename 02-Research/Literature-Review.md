 - in silico deep developed to overcome the high attrition rates by predicting the crystallization propensities of proteins
 - Harmonic networks [[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X22000471?utm_source=chatgpt.com#bib51)] have achieved rotation-equivariance in 2D. Recently, Thomas etÂ al. [[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X22000471?utm_source=chatgpt.com#bib52)] have published a rather widely-cited preprint on Tensor Field Networks, or TFNs, which operates on geometric tensors, scalars and vectors, and is therefore naturally translation- and rotation-equivariant. TFNs can be seen as a generalization of CNNs.
