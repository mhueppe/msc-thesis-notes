This paper investigates the **Legionella pneumophila effector protein Lem3**, which **removes a phosphocholine group** from **Ser76 of the host protein Rab1b**, a small GTPase involved in **vesicular trafficking**. 

###  **Key Findings**

- **AnkX**, another Legionella effector, adds a **phosphocholine group** to Ser76 of Rab1b, disrupting its normal function during infection.
- **Lem3 acts as a dephosphocholinase**, reversing the modification done by AnkX.
- Using **crystallography**, the authors solved structures of:    
    - Lem3 alone (apo-form).        
    - Lem3 in complex with Rab1b (with a covalent link to stabilize this transient interaction).

### **Significance**

- Provides **structural and mechanistic insight** into how bacterial pathogens manipulate host cell signaling.    
- Establishes a **generalizable method** to study weak or transient proteinâ€“protein interactions via covalent trapping.    
- Suggests broader roles for **PPM-fold enzymes** beyond traditional phosphatase activity.
