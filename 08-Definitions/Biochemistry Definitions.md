# Alveolar macrophages

Immune cells located in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. They are a type of macrophage that play a key role in the respiratory defense system by ingesting and digesting pathogens, allergens, and debris. Alveolar macrophages help maintain lung homeostasis and are the first line of defense against airborne particles and microbes. They also regulate inflammation and communicate with other immune cells to coordinate immune responses.

---
# endoplasmic reticulum

A network of membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, involved in protein and lipid synthesis.
